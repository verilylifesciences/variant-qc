Data Analysis using Google Genomics
===================================

The following example makes use of the [Phase 1 variants](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20110521/README.phase1_integrated_release_version3_20120430) from the [1,000 Genomes Project](http://www.1000genomes.org/).  For more detail about how this data was loaded into the Google Genomics API, please see [Google Genomics Public Data](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/data/1000-genomes).

The VCFs comprising this dataset are **1.12 TB** when uncompressed and provide information about **39,706,715** variants for **1,092** individuals.

Working at Scale
-------------------

### Cluster Computing

Suppose we have a new dataset.  One of the first things we might do is a basic visualization.  Let's start by projecting the relevant data into 2-dimensional space by performing a [Principal Coordinate Analysis](http://occamstypewriter.org/boboh/2012/01/17/pca_and_pcoa_explained/) based on the number of variants shared by each pair of individuals.

In this example we are reading in previously computed results, but with [just a few clicks](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/hadoop/click-to-deploy), its easy to spin up a [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) cluster on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/hadoop/what-is-hadoop) and run this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# This codelab assumes that the current working directory is where the Rmd file resides
setwd("/YOUR/PATH/TO/codelabs/R/1000Genomes-BRCA1-analysis")
```

```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
pca_1kg <- read.table("./data/1kg-pca.tsv", col.names=c("Sample", "PC1", "PC2"))
```
This analysis performed an `O(N^2)` computation upon the relevant fields within the *terabyte* of data by running an [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) job which used the [Google Genomics Variants API](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/v1beta2/reference/variants) for its input.  Please see [the instructions](https://github.com/googlegenomics/spark-examples) for how to run this job and the relevant [source code](https://github.com/googlegenomics/spark-examples/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/google/cloud/genomics/spark/examples/VariantsPca.scala#L37) for implementation details.  When running upon X cores, this job typically takes Y minutes.

Visualizing the results, we see quite distinct clusters:
```{r pca, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(pca_1kg) +
  geom_point(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2)) +
  xlab("principal component 1") +
  ylab("principal component 2") +
  ggtitle("Principal Coordinate Analysis upon 1,000 Genomes")
```

Let's pull in the [supplementary information](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/README_20130606_sample_info) we do have on these samples from [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/):
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
sample_info <- read.csv("http://storage.googleapis.com/genomics-public-data/1000-genomes/other/sample_info/sample_info.csv")
require(dplyr)
pca_1kg <- inner_join(pca_1kg, sample_info)
```

Applying sample ethnicity to the plot:
```{r pca-with-ethnicity, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
ggplot(pca_1kg) +
  geom_point(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Super_Population)) +
  xlab("principal component 1") +
  ylab("principal component 2") +
  ggtitle("Principal Coordinate Analysis upon 1,000 Genomes")
```

we see that ethnicity appears to strongly correlate with the clusters.

### Querying

Let's also visualize a different aspect of this data by examining the variant counts for each individual of heterozygous reference variants (where one of the alleles is equal to the reference) and heterozygous alternate variants (where neither of the alleles is equal to the reference).

```{r comment=NA, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Setup for BigQuery access
require(bigrquery)
project <- "genomics-public-data"                   # put your projectID here
DisplayAndDispatchQuery <- function(queryUri, replacements=list()) {
  querySql <- readChar(queryUri, nchars=1e6)
  cat(querySql)
  for(replacement in names(replacements)) {
    querySql <- sub(replacement, replacements[[replacement]], querySql, fixed=TRUE)
  }
  query_exec(querySql, project)
}
```

```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
sample_alt_counts <- DisplayAndDispatchQuery("./sql/sample-alt-counts.sql")
```
Number of rows returned by this query: `r nrow(sample_alt_counts)`.

This analysis performed an `O(N)` computation via [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/).  Since BigQuery is a columnar data store, it scans only the columns referenced by the query.  In this case, 1 TB of data was scanned, typically within 10 seconds.

Visualizing the results, we again see quite distinct clusters:
```{r alt-counts, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
sample_alt_counts <- inner_join(sample_alt_counts, sample_info)
require(scales) # for scientific_format()
ggplot(sample_alt_counts) +
  geom_point(aes(x=single, y=double, color=Super_Population)) +
  scale_x_continuous(label=scientific_format()) +
  scale_y_continuous(label=scientific_format()) +
  xlab("Variants with a single non-reference allele") +
  ylab("Variants with two non-reference alleles") +
  ggtitle("Heterozygosity Counts within 1,000 Genomes")
```

Zooming-In
------------------------

Suppose we are interested in examining variants within the BRCA1 gene.  We might run our PCoA a second time, zooming-in specifically to this region within the genome.

Again in this example we read in previously computed results, but since the amount of data over which we are computing is much less, it is feasible to run this Spark job on a local machine in just a few minutes.
```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
pca_1kg_brca1 <- read.table("./data/1kg-brca1-pca.tsv", col.names=c("Sample", "PC1", "PC2"))
```

Examining this data visually:
```{r brca1-pca, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
ggplot(pca_1kg_brca1) +
  geom_point(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2)) +
  xlab("principal component 1") +
  ylab("principal component 2") +
  ggtitle("Principal Coordinate Analysis upon BRCA1 within 1,000 Genomes")
```

we see distinct clusters with a structure much different than our former result upon the entire dataset.

Let's apply the sample information we do have (just gender and ethnicity) to this visualization to see if any of it appears to explain the clustering.  First, we'll try gender:
```{r brca1-pca-with-gender, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
pca_1kg_brca1 <- inner_join(pca_1kg_brca1, sample_info)
ggplot(pca_1kg_brca1) +
  geom_point(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Gender)) +
  xlab("principal component 1") +
  ylab("principal component 2") +
  ggtitle("Principal Coordinate Analysis upon BRCA1 within 1,000 Genomes")
```

which has no apparent bearing on these variants.

Next, we'll try ethnicity:
```{r brca1-pca-with-ethnicity, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
ggplot(pca_1kg_brca1) +
  geom_point(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Super_Population)) +
  xlab("principal component 1") +
  ylab("principal component 2") +
  ggtitle("Principal Coordinate Analysis upon BRCA1 within 1,000 Genomes")
```

which does appear to correlate to some amount of the clustering in the second principal component axis but not in the first principal component axis.

Let's split these individuals into two groups based on their position relative to the origin of the first principal component:
```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
pca_1kg_brca1 <- mutate(pca_1kg_brca1, 
                        case = 0 > PC1)
```
And visualize them again with their grouping:
```{r brca1-pca-case-control, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
ggplot(pca_1kg_brca1) +
  geom_point(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Super_Population, shape=case), size=3) +
  xlab("principal component 1") +
  ylab("principal component 2") +
  ggtitle("Principal Coordinate Analysis upon BRCA1 within 1,000 Genomes")
```

### Simplistic GWAS

Next we perform a [simplistic GWAS](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~suinlee/genome560/lecture7.pdf) on the BRCA1 variants to retrieve a ranked list of the variants that appear to differentiate these groups.
```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
case_sample_ids <- paste("'", filter(pca_1kg_brca1, case==TRUE)$Sample, "'", sep="", collapse=",")
result <- DisplayAndDispatchQuery("./sql/gwas-brca1-pattern.sql",
                                  list(CASE_SAMPLE_IDS__=case_sample_ids))
```
Number of rows returned by this query: `r nrow(result)`.

Note that even though this query ran over a small region of the genome, with a minor change to the SQL we could have run this same GWAS query over all variants within a much larger region, over an entire chromosome, or even the full dataset; returning the ranked list of variants that differ between the two groups.
```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
head(result)
```

### Annotate Variants with BioConductor

Now let's use the [GoogleGenomics R client](https://github.com/googlegenomics/api-client-r) to retrieve the full records for the variants in which we are interested.
```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
require(GoogleGenomics)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
authenticate(file="YOUR/PATH/TO/client_secrets.json")
```

```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
top_results_sorted_by_start <- arrange(head(result, 20), start)
variants <- Reduce(c, apply(top_results_sorted_by_start,
                           1,
                           function(var) {
                             getVariants(datasetId="10473108253681171589",
                                         chromosome=as.character(var["reference_name"]),
                                         start=as.integer(var["start"]),
                                         end=as.integer(var["end"]))
                             }))
length(variants)
names(variants[[1]])
length(variants[[1]]$calls)
names(variants[[1]]$calls[[1]])
variants[[1]]$calls[[1]]
```

We can also convert this data to [BioConductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) datatypes such as [GRanges data type](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/GenomicRanges/inst/doc/GenomicRangesIntroduction.pdf).
```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
granges <- variantsToGRanges(variants)
granges
```

This allows us to utilize the various BioConductor variant annotation packages:

```{r comment=NA, message=FALSE}
require(VariantAnnotation)
require(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
require(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
codingVariants <- locateVariants(granges, txdb, CodingVariants())
codingVariants

coding <- predictCoding(rep(granges, elementLengths(granges$ALT)),
                        txdb,
                        seqSource=Hsapiens,
                        varAllele=unlist(granges$ALT, use.names=FALSE))
coding
```

So a question for our users who have much experience in this domain: what should we examine next to determine potential explanations for the clustering we see?  Perhaps the relevant [ancestral haplotypes](http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/originhaplotype.html)?

Zooming-in Even Further
------------------------

### Visualize Reads with BioConductor

We can also retrieve the reads from the [Genomics Reads API](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/v1beta2/reference/readgroupsets) for a given sample and examine coverage:
```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
galignments <- getReads(readGroupSetId="CMvnhpKTFhDnk4_9zcKO3_YB", chromosome="17",
                     start=41218200, end=41218500, converter=readsToGAlignments)
galignments
```

```{r alignments, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
require(ggbio)
strand_plot <- autoplot(galignments, aes(color=strand, fill=strand))
coverage_plot <- ggplot(as(galignments, "GRanges")) + stat_coverage(color="gray40",
                                                      fill="skyblue")
tracks(strand_plot, coverage_plot, xlab="chr17")
```

See also [GABrowse](http://gabrowse.appspot.com/#=&location=17%3A41218331&readsetId=CMvnhpKTFhDnk4_9zcKO3_YB&backend=GOOGLE) for an interactive Reads browser.

In summary, in this demo from the R prompt we were able to exercise both large scale and small scale data analysis using cloud-based infrastructure.

Provenance
-------------------
Lastly, let us capture version information about R and loaded packages for the sake of provenance.
```{r message=FALSE, comment=NA}
sessionInfo()
```
